# A Web-Based Instance Generator for the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Road Junctions and Road Types

This repository provides a web application for generating instances of the **Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Road Junctions and Road Types (EVRP-RJ-RT)**. It combines a **Flask** (Python) backend (with OSMnx for map data) and a **React** frontend to configure and visualize generated instances.

---

## How to Run the Instance Generator Using Docker (Locally)

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** must be installed and running on your system.
  - **Linux**: Ensure your user is in the `docker` group and that Docker is active.
  - **Windows/macOS**: Install **Docker Desktop**.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

1. **Clone** or download this repository.
2. **Open a terminal** in the repository's root directory (where the `Dockerfile` is located).
3. **Build** the Docker image by running:
   
   ```bash
   docker build -t evrp-generator .
   ```
   This command reads the `Dockerfile`, installs Python and Node.js dependencies, compiles the React frontend, and bundles everything with Flask & Gunicorn.

### 2. Run the Container

Once the image is built successfully, run:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 evrp-generator
```

- `-d` starts the container in **detached mode**.
- `-p 5000:5000` maps port **5000** in the container to port **5000** on your local machine.
- The container will start **Gunicorn**, serving the Flask application.

### 3. Access the Web Interface

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

You should see the **EVRP Instance Generator** interface. From here, you can:

- Select an area of interest
- Configure node counts
- Set demand/service-time options
- Customize vehicle configurations
- Click **"Generate Instance"** to build and visualize an instance

### 4. Outputs & Downloads

Once the generation process is complete, the **Results** tab provides options to download:

- **Dataset** (`.txt` file)
- **HTML Visualization** (`.html` file)
- **Summary File** (`_summary.txt` file)

These files are stored in the containerâ€™s `/app/created_datasets` directory. If you need them on your host machine, you can either **mount a volume** or **download them via the web interface**.

### 5. Stopping the Container

To stop the running container:

1. Find its **ID** or **name** using:
   
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. Stop it with:
   
   ```bash
   docker stop <container-id-or-name>
   ```

### Further Notes

- **Port Conflicts**: If port `5000` is already in use, modify the host port mapping, e.g., `-p 8081:5000`, then visit `http://localhost:8081`.
- **Editing Code**: If you modify the code or `requirements.txt`, you must rebuild the image by running:
  
  ```bash
  docker build -t evrp-generator .
  ```
- **Running Locally Without Docker**: If you prefer to run the application **natively** (without Docker), refer to the local setup instructions in `backend/requirements.txt`.
